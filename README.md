svg2gcode
=========

an svg-file to gcode converter using optimized paths. Written in C and nanosvg.h by Mikko Mononen. 
Compiles on OS X, Linux, Windows or maybe on every platform having C-compiler.

The paths are optimized to minimize unnecessary movements of the cutter or whatever you're using.

Tested on Linux, OS X and Win7. To change the inits and and other needed g-codes, just change the #defines and compile.
No extra needed libraries.
